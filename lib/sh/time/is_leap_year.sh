# @description Test whether a given year is a leap year.
#   A year is a leap year if divisible by 4, except century years,
#   which must be divisible by 400.
#
# @arg $1 int Four-digit year
#
# @example
#   time_is_leap_year 2000  # => exit 0 (leap)
#   time_is_leap_year 1900  # => exit 1 (not leap)
#   time_is_leap_year 2024  # => exit 0 (leap)
#
# @exitcode 0 Is a leap year
# @exitcode 1 Not a leap year
# @exitcode 2 Missing argument
