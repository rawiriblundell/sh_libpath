    (308)
      _http_status_code='Permanent Redirect'

    (403)
      _http_status_code='Forbidden'
      _http_status_description="The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource. Unlike 401 Unauthorized, the client's identity is known to the server."
    ;;
    (404)
      _http_status_code='Not Found'
      _http_status_description='The server can not find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist. Servers may also send this response instead of 403 Forbidden to hide the existence of a resource from an unauthorized client. This response code is probably the most well known due to its frequent occurrence on the web.'
    ;;

    (408)
      _http_status_code='Request Timeout'
      _http_status_description='This response is sent on an idle connection by some servers, even without any previous request by the client. It means that the server would like to shut down this unused connection. This response is used much more since some browsers, like Chrome, Firefox 27+, or IE9, use HTTP pre-connection mechanisms to speed up surfing. Also note that some servers merely shut down the connection without sending this message.'

      _http_status_code='Conflict'
      _http_status_description='This response is sent when a request conflicts with the current state of the server.'
    ;;
    (410)
      _http_status_code='Gone'
      _http_status_description='This response is sent when the requested content has been permanently deleted from server, with no forwarding address. Clients are expected to remove their caches and links to the resource. The HTTP specification intends this status code to be used for "limited-time, promotional services". APIs should not feel compelled to indicate resources that have been deleted with this status code.'
    ;;

      _http_status_description='The URI requested by the client is longer than the server is willing to interpret.'
    ;;
    (415)
      _http_status_code='Unsupported Media Type'
      _http_status_description='The media format of the requested data is not supported by the server, so the server is rejecting the request.'
    ;;
    (416)
      _http_status_code='Range Not Satisfiable'
      _http_status_description="The range specified by the Range header field in the request cannot be fulfilled. It's possible that the range is outside the size of the target URI's data."
    ;;

      _http_status_description='(Non-standard, Spring Framework) A deprecated response used by the Spring Framework when a method has failed.
      (Non-standard, Twitter) Returned by version 1 of the Twitter Search and Trends API when the client is being rate limited; versions 1.1 and later use the 429 Too Many Requests response code instead. The phrase "Enhance your calm" comes from the 1993 movie Demolition Man, and its association with this number is likely a reference to cannabis.'
    ;;
    (421)
      _http_status_code='Misdirected Request'
      _http_status_description='The request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response. This can be sent by a server that is not configured to produce responses for the combination of scheme and authority that are included in the request URI.'

    ;;
    (428)
      _http_status_code='Precondition Required'
      _http_status_description="The origin server requires the request to be conditional. This response is intended to prevent the 'lost update' problem, where a client GETs a resource's state, modifies it and PUTs it back to the server, when meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server, leading to a conflict."
