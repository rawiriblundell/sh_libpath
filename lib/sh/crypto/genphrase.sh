# @description Generate random passphrases from a word dictionary file (~/.pwords.dict).
#   Produces XKCD "Correct Horse Battery Staple" style phrases; see -S for stronger
#   alternatives. Requires the 'capitalise' function and optionally 'shuf' or 'rand'.
#
# @arg $1 string Optional flags: -h (help), -n N (count), -s word (seed word),
#   -S (seed explanation), -w N (words per phrase)
#
# @stdout One or more passphrases, one per line
# @exitcode 0 Success
# @exitcode 1 Dictionary file unavailable, or required dependency missing
