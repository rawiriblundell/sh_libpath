# Instead of flooding the screen with garbage, just give the illusion of something happening.

# The above code selects a (hopefully) modulo-debiased number between 32 and 126 and cycles through the ASCII table, printing through every character until it reaches the desired character.

# For example, let's say we get a number of 38, which corresponds with `&`, it will cycle through like this:

# * Save location
# * print dec 32: ` `
# * Return to saved location
# * print dec 33: `!`
# * Return to saved location
# * print dec 34: `"`
# * and so on through these characters: ` !"#$%&`

# Because we're always returning to the saved location, it will appear as if each character is overwriting the previous one in place, giving a cycling effect.  Ultimately, you'll get an output that looks like:

#     $ connectssh remotepants
#     Connecting to remotepants, using additional hashing: CcJjeTt+KkEeWwpeJj9Y
#     (connectssh) FATAL ERROR: remotepants unreachable!


# Because it's called `connectssh` it looks legit-ish without being Mr Robot levels of accuracy.

# It's a bit `bash`y so it may need adjustment for mobile usage, and it could do with a little more polish.
