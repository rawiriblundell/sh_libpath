# @description Protect header lines from being filtered by downstream pipes.
#   Reads stdin into an array, emits the first n lines (default: 1) to stderr,
#   and the remainder to stdout. This keeps header lines visible even when
#   stdout is piped to grep or similar filters.
#
# @arg $1 int Optional: number of header lines to protect (default: 1)
#
# @example
#   df -hP | helmet | grep shm
#   df -hP | helmet 2 | grep shm
#
# @stdout Input lines after the protected header lines
# @exitcode 0 Always
