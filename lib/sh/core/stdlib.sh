# @description Load a curated baseline set of shellac libraries.
#   Equivalent to a language stdlib — the functions you almost always
#   end up sourcing in any non-trivial script.
#
#   Requires: include() must already be available (i.e. source this via
#   'include core/stdlib', not by direct dot-sourcing).
#
#   The sentinel pattern on each library makes repeated inclusion free,
#   so loading stdlib alongside explicit includes is safe.
#
# @example
#   include core/stdlib
#
# @exitcode 0 All libraries loaded successfully
# @exitcode 1 One or more libraries failed to load
