# @description Show processes sorted by resource usage. With no argument, runs
#   all three reports (cpu, mem, swap) in sequence. Passes any trailing
#   arguments through to the underlying hog function (e.g. a line count).
#
# @arg $1 string Optional: cpu, mem, or swap to show a single report
# @arg $@ string Optional: arguments passed through to the hog function (e.g. 20)
#
# @example
#   sys_hogs          # all three reports
#   sys_hogs cpu      # CPU hogs only
#   sys_hogs mem 20   # top 20 memory hogs
#
# @stdout Tabular process list, colour-coded when stdout is a tty
# @exitcode 0 Always
# @exitcode 1 Unrecognised argument
