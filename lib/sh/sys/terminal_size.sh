  # At this point, you're relegated to raw ANSI.

  # i.e. some out of bounds position beyond the lower right
  # The cursor should find itself at the lowest right position
  # '\e[6n' performs a CPR (cursor position report)
  # This comes back like '^[[24;80R(PS1 printed here);80R' and isn't readily piped
  # We use IFS to strip '[' and ';' and split, delimit on 'R' and assign to our vars
  # May require a position save and restore to be added...
  # Note, also, that this isn't strict POSIX: POSIX read only specifies '-r'
